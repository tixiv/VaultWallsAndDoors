Allows you to build a vault. Walls and doors. Embrasures now too! Thanks to TeflonJim for making the embrasure images and configuration.

Essentially this mod adds walls, embrasures, and doors that are nearly indestructible. Think bank vault. No amount of shooting a gun at a bank vault is likely to break a section of it down, and this provides for that. 

The walls, embrasures, and doors are nigh on unbreakable. If you're really heavy with resources (materials and labor), this mod will allow you to build a base that no sapper is going to get through any time soon. The walls, embrasures, and doors cannot be bashed through with blunt objects, and they are very resilient to all other types of attacks. The walls, embrasures, and doors are not flammable. 

All that said, the 'Indestructible' label is a bit of a misnomer, as the walls, embrasures, and doors do have hitpoints (albeit very high hitpoints, and the damage amount from all types of attacks is reduced).

Mod order should not matter for this mod. You can add this to a game that is already in progress without issue. These items are industrial in tech, and do require stone or metal, and devilstrand.
